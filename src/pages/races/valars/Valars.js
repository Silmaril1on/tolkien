          </div>
          The Valar (Quenya; singular Vala) were the Powers of Arda who governed
          the world under the direction of Eru Ilúvatar. They dwelt on the
          western continent of Aman.

          The Valar were the fourteen <b>Ainur</b> who, after being molded of{" "}
          <b>Eru's</b>
          thought, entered <b>Arda</b> after <b>its creation</b>, to give order
          to the world and combat the new evils of <b>Melkor</b>. They had
          helped to begin the shaping of Arda through the music of{" "}
          <b>Ilúvatar</b>, and often referred to one another as "brother" or
          "sister". Each of the Ainur had added his or her own part to the music
          creating the world incarnate, save for Melkor, who at the time was
          counted as the strongest of them. His vision of what Arda should have
          been differed from Eru's, which led to his banishment and great
          rebellion that would cause most of the ills of the world of Arda.{" "}

          </div>
          Following the creation, the fourteen Valar dwelt first on{" "}
          <b>Almaren</b>, a hidden island on the <b>Great Lake</b>, but, after
          it was destroyed and the earth was reshaped, long before the{" "}
          <b>Awakening of the Elves</b>, they relocated to <b>Aman</b> and
          founded the realm of <b>Valinor</b>. They would become known as the
          'Powers of the World', though rarely directly intervening in the
          world's course of events. Eru instead gave them delegation of{" "}
          <b>Arda</b>, and so at Valinor they constructed the golden city of{" "}
          <b>Valimar</b>, their own mansions dispersed across the plain; and
          <b>Máhanaxar</b>, the "Ring of Doom", at which they would confer and
          hold counsels. <br />

          </div>
          Eru created for them lesser heavenly beings named the 'Maiar', who
          were their servants. Though subordinate to the Valar, the <b>Maiar</b>{" "}
          were powerful nonetheless, and included <b>Melian</b>, <b>Sauron</b>{" "}
          (named Mairon),
          <b>Olórin</b> (later named Gandalf) and the other <b>Istari</b>, and
          those who would become the <b>Balrogs</b>. Most Maiar were associated
          with particular Valar:
          <b>Ossë</b> and <b>Uinen</b>, the "powers of the oceans", served under{" "}
          <b>Ulmo</b>, while
          <b> Curumo</b> (much later known as Saruman), served <b>Aulë</b> the
          Smith. Sauron also served Aulë before he was corrupted by Melkor. It
          was originally Melkor's intention to rule Arda for himself, but Manwë,
          the superior of the Valar, called other spirits to help him confront
          Melkor. (Among these were the other Valar and the Maiar.) Melkor
          withdrew from Arda after the short <b>Battle of the Powers</b>, and
          the Valar continued their creation and furnishing of the World, while
          Melkor plotted to return and regain dominance. In time, once he
          returned in secret and ruined the <b>Two Trees of Valinor</b> with{" "}
          <b>Ungoliant</b>, Valinor lost its light, and the Valar eventually set
          to creating the <b>Sun</b> and <b>Moon</b> in the sky. <br />

          </div>
          These are the names of the Valar as they were known to the Eldar. In
          Middle-earth, they were known by other names of Sindarin origin; for
          example they called Varda Elbereth. Men knew them by many other names,
          and sometimes worshiped them as Gods. The Elves called Varda, the
          creator of the stars, Elentári. The dwarves called Aulë, their
          creator, Mahal. The Ents called Yavanna, their creator, Kementári. It
          should be noted that, with the exception of Oromë, the names listed
          below are not actual names but rather titles: the true names of the
          Valar are nowhere recorded. Male Valar are called "Lords of the
          Valar"; females are called "Ladies of the Valar", or Valier. Among
          these exist six married couples, with only Ulmo and Nienna remaining{" "}
          <br />
          <br />
          single. The <b>War of the Jewels</b> was prompted after <b>Fëanor</b>{" "}
          refused to forfeit his
          <b> Silmarils</b> to the Valar, for the rekindling of the Two Trees.
          He ended his and the Ñoldor's allegiance with the Valar, and bore a
          new conflict between the Elves and Melkor. The Valar soon fortified
          their realm, and brought about the "Hiding of Valinor", preventing
          Melkor and Fëanor and his followers from entering. The conflict
          between Melkor and the Valar was not resolved until the war's climax,
          during which the Valar came physically into <b>Beleriand</b>, helped
          conquer Melkor's forces at <b>Angband</b>, and captured him. He was
          taken to Aman and cast behind the <b>Door of Night</b>. <br />

            <h6>Yavanna as imagined by David Greset</h6>
          </div>
          In the <b>Second Age</b>, the Valar created anew the island of{" "}
          <b>Elenna</b> in the middle of the <b>Sea</b>, for the noble peoples
          of the <b>Edain</b> who had resisted and endured the war against{" "}
          <b>Melkor</b>. On this island was established the kingdom of Númenor,
          which lasted three millennia until their king
          <b>Ar-Pharazôn</b> attempted to contravene the Ban of the Valar. The
          Valar sank the island, and the living Númenóreans sailed eastward, and
          settled Middle-earth. Once Sauron had begun to regain power in
          Middle-earth after his defeat in the <b>War of the Last Alliance</b>,
          the Valar sent an order of five Maiar, the <b>"Istari"</b>, unto
          Middle-earth, to provide a strong opposition to <b>Sauron</b> until
          his final destruction. <br />
          <br />
          Like the other Ainur, the powers of the Valar were ambiguously
          mysterious. The Valar had similar and superior abilities to the Maiar,
          such as the controlling light and of fire, transforming into many
          forms, or trancing Men or Elves with their presence. Manwë and Ulmo
          controlled the winds and waters of Arda, respectively. Yavanna and
          Nienna created the Two Trees, <b>Laurelin</b> and <b>Telperion</b>, to
          illuminate much of Aman. Varda could realign stars into constellations
          that prophesied the doom of Morgoth. The Valar together had the power
          to raise the vast island of <b>Númenor</b> up to the surface of the
          Sea.

              The Vala Mandos at the entrance to his Halls - by Ralph Damiani
            </h6>
          </div>
          <br />
          <br />
          The Aratar (Sindarin: Exalted) or High Ones of Arda were the eight
          greatest of the Valar: Manwë, Varda, Ulmo, Yavanna, Aulë, Mandos,
          Nienna, and Oromë. Melkor, the most powerful of all, is not counted
          among them. Lórien and Mandos were brothers, and would be referred to
          together as the Fëanturi or "Masters of Spirits". In earlier versions
          of the legendarium, "Gods" was a word used often to refer to them, and
          Valur and Valir for a short time denoted male and female Valar.
          <br />
          <br />
          The names and attributes of the chief Valar, as they are known to the
          Elves in Valinor, are listed below. In Middle-earth, they are known by
          their Sindarin names: Varda, for example, is called Elbereth. Men know
          them by many other names, and sometimes worship them as gods. With the
          exception of Oromë, the names listed below are not actual names but
          rather titles: The true names of the Valar are nowhere recorded. The
          males are called "Lords of the Valar", and the females are called
          "Queens of the Valar," or Valier. Of the seven male and seven female
          Valar, there are six married pairs: Ulmo and Nienna are the only ones
          who dwell alone. This is evidently a spiritual rather than a physical
          union, as in Tolkien's later conception they do not reproduce. The
          Aratar (Quenya: Exalted), or High Ones of Arda, are the eight greatest
          of the Valar: Manwë, Varda, Ulmo, Yavanna, Aulë, Mandos, Nienna, and
          Oromë. Lórien and Mandos are brothers and are collectively called as
          the Fëanturi, "Masters of Spirits". Ilúvatar brings the Valar (and all
          the Ainur) into being by his thought and may therefore be considered
          their father. However, not all the Valar are siblings; where this is
          held to be so, it is because they are so "in the thought of Ilúvatar".
          It was the Valar who first practise marriage and later pass on their
          custom to the Elves; all the Valar have spouses, save Nienna, Ulmo,
          and Melkor. Only one such marriage among the Valar takes place within
          the world, that of Tulkas and Nessa after the raising of the Two
          Lamps.
