          <b>John Ronald Reuel Tolkien</b>, CBE, (3 January, 1892 - 2 September,
          1973) was a philologist and writer, best known as the author of The
          Hobbit and its sequel The Lord of the Rings. He worked as reader and
          professor in English language at the University of Leeds from 1920 to
          1925; as professor of Anglo-Saxon language at the University of Oxford
          from 1925 to 1945; and of English language and literature from 1945
          until his retirement in 1959. Tolkien was a close friend of C.S.
          Lewis, and a member of the Inklings, a literary discussion group to
          which both Lewis and Owen Barfield belonged. <br />
          <br /> Tolkien created a legendarium, a fictional mythology about the
          remote past of Earth, of which Middle-earth in particular is the main
          stage. Parts of his legendarium are The Hobbit and The Lord of the
          Rings. The Silmarillion and The History of Middle-earth series
          (published by his son, Christopher Tolkien, posthumously) revealed
          Tolkien's lifelong work on that same legendarium, a process which he
          called "sub-creation". Tolkien's other published works includes
          philological essays, modern adaptations of medieval literature and
          rendering of stories originally told to his children but not directly
          related to the legendarium.

          Tolkien was born on January 3, 1892, in Bloemfontein in the Orange
          Free State (now the Free State province of South Africa) to Arthur
          Reuel Tolkien (1857 – 1896), an English bank manager, and his wife
          Mabel, née Suffield (1870 – 1904). Tolkien had one sibling, his
          younger brother, <b>Hilary Arthur Reuel</b>, who was born on February
          17, 1894. He was addressed by his family as “Ronald” as it has no
          history of use in the Tolkien family. <br />
          <br /> While living in Africa he was bitten by a large 'baboon
          spider', and this echoes in his stories. However, Tolkien said that he
          did not develop a particular fear of spiders after this event, and,
          when he was older, recalled picking small spiders up and putting them
          outside. <br />
          <br /> When he was three, Tolkien went to England with his mother and
          brother on what was intended to be a lengthy family visit. His father,
          however, died in South Africa of a severe brain haemorrhage before he
          could join them. This left the family without an income, so Tolkien's
          mother took him to live with her parents in Birmingham, England. Soon
          after in 1896, they moved to Sarehole (now in Hall Green), then a
          Worcestershire village, later annexed to Birmingham. He enjoyed
          exploring <b>Sarehole Mill</b> and Moseley Bog and the Clent Hills and
          Lickey Hills, which would later inspire scenes in his books along with
          other Worcestershire towns and villages such as Bromsgrove, Alcester
          and Alvechurch and places such as his aunt's farm of Bag End, the name
          of which would be used in his fiction. <br />

          </div>
          <br /> Ronald and Hilary Tolkien in 1905 Mabel tutored her two sons,
          and Ronald, as he was known in the family, was a keen pupil. She
          taught him a great deal of botany, and she awoke in her son the
          enjoyment of the look and feel of plants. Young Tolkien liked to draw
          landscapes and trees. But his favourite lessons were those concerning
          languages, and his mother taught him the rudiments of Latin very
          early. He could read by the age of four, and could write fluently soon
          afterwards. He attended King Edward's School, Birmingham and, while a
          student there, helped "line the route" for the coronation parade of
          King George V, being posted just outside the gates of Buckingham
          Palace. He later attended St. Philip's School and Exeter College,
          Oxford. <br />
          <br /> His mother converted to Roman Catholicism in 1900, despite
          vehement protests by her Baptist family. She died of diabetes in 1904,
          when Tolkien was twelve, at Fern Cottage, Rednal, which they were then
          renting. For the rest of his life, Tolkien felt that she had become a
          martyr for her faith; this had a profound effect on his own Catholic
          beliefs. Tolkien's devout faith was significant in the conversion of
          C.S. Lewis to Anglicanism. <br />
          <br /> During his subsequent orphanhood he was brought up by Father
          Francis Xavier Morgan of the Birmingham Oratory, in the Edgbaston area
          of Birmingham. He lived there in the shadow of Perrott's Folly and the
          Victorian tower of Edgbaston waterworks, which may have influenced the
          images of the dark towers within his works. Another strong influence
          was the romantic medievalist paintings of Edward Burne-Jones and the
          Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood; the Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery has
          a large and world-renowned collection of works and had put it on free
          public display from around 1908.

          Tolkien met and fell in love with Edith Mary Bratt, three years his
          senior, at the age of sixteen. Father Francis forbade him from
          meeting, talking, or even corresponding with her until he was
          twenty-one. He obeyed this prohibition to the letter. In 1911, while
          they were at King Edward's School, Birmingham, Tolkien and three
          friends, Robert Gilson, Geoffrey Bache Smith and
          <b> Christopher Wiseman</b>, formed a semi-secret society which they
          called "the T.C.B.S.", the initials standing for "Tea Club and
          Barrovian Society", alluding to their fondness of drinking tea in
          Barrow's Stores near the school and, illegally, in the school library.
          After leaving school, the members stayed in touch, and in December 25
          1914, they held a "Council" in London, at Wiseman's home. For Tolkien,
          the result of this meeting was a strong dedication to writing poetry.

          <br /> In the summer of 1911, Tolkien went on holiday in Switzerland,
          a trip that he recollects vividly in a 1968 letter, noting that
          Bilbo's journey across the Misty Mountains ("including the glissade
          down the slithering stones into the pine woods") is directly based on
          his adventures as their party of twelve hiked from Interlaken to
          Lauterbrunnen, and on to camp in the moraines beyond Mürren.
          Fifty-seven years later, Tolkien remembers his regret at leaving the
          view of the eternal snows of Jungfrau and Silberhorn ("the Silvertine
          (Celebdil) of my dreams"). They went across the Kleine Scheidegg on to
          Grindelwald and across the Grosse Scheidegg to Meiringen. They
          continued across the Grimsel Pass and through the upper Valais to
          Brig, and on to the Aletsch glacier and Zermatt. <br />

          Tolkien in 1916, wearing his British Army uniform in a photograph from
          the middle years of WWI On the evening of his twenty-first birthday
          (1913), Tolkien wrote to Edith a declaration of his love and asked her
          to marry him. She replied saying that she was already engaged, but had
          done so because she had believed Tolkien had forgotten her. The two
          met up and beneath a railway viaduct renewed their love, with Edith
          returning her ring and choosing to marry Tolkien instead. A condition
          of their engagement was that she was to convert to Catholicism for
          him. They were engaged in Birmingham, in January 1913. <br />
          <br />
          With his childhood love of landscape, he visited Cornwall in 1914 and
          he was said to be deeply impressed by the singular Cornish coastline
          and sea. By late 1914, his final year at the University of Oxford, he
          joined the Officer's Training Corps. After his graduation (Exeter
          College, Oxford) with a first-class degree in English language in
          1915, Tolkien joined the British Army effort in <b>World War I</b>. In
          late '15 he received military training at Rugeley Camp in
          Staffordshire and served as a second lieutenant in the eleventh
          battalion of the Lancashire Fusiliers. Tolkien married Edith in
          Warwick, England, on March 22, 1916 before leaving for the War. His
          battalion was moved to France in 1916, where Tolkien served as a
          communications officer during the Battle of the Somme, until he came
          down with trench fever on October 27, and was moved back to England on
          November 8. Many of his fellow servicemen, as well as many of his
          closest friends, were killed in the war. During his recovery in a
          cottage in Great Haywood, Staffordshire, England, he began to work on
          what he called The Book of Lost Tales, beginning with The
          <b>Fall of Gondolin</b>. <br />
          <br /> Throughout 1917 and 1918 his illness kept recurring, but he had
          recovered enough to do home service at various camps, and was promoted
          to lieutenant. When he was stationed at Thirtle Bridge, East
          Yorkshire, one day he and Edith went walking in the woods at nearby
          Roos, and Edith began to dance for him in a clearing thick with
          hemlock plants in bloom. This incident inspired the account of the
          meeting of <b>Beren</b> and <b>Lúthien</b>, and Tolkien often referred
          to Edith as his Lúthien.

        <p id="leeds" className="responsive-p">
          <ContentHeader>Leeds and Oxford</ContentHeader>
          Tolkien's first civilian job after World War I was at the
          <b> Oxford English Dictionary</b> (among others, he initiated the
          entries "wasp" and "walrus"). In 1920 he took up a post as Reader in
          English language at the <b> University of Leeds</b>, and in 1924 was
          made a professor there. The start was rough: though Gordon found
          Tolkien a room in Leeds, Edith and young John still lived in Oxford.
          In weekends, Tolkien would go to his family - now expanded with the
          birth of Michael. Not until 1921 did Tolkien get full housing for his
          family, first at 5 Holly Bank and then at 11 St. Mark's Terrace. They
          later moved to 2 Darnley Road. Since 1920, Tolkien dedicated his time,
          even vacations, to finding extra work to supplement his family's
          income, especially for doctor bills and educate his children. <br />
          <br /> He "stole" some free time for himself and his personal hobby of
          writing his own mythology. W. A. Craigie resigned from the post of
          <b> Rawlinson and Bosworth Professorship of Anglo-Saxon</b> at the
          Oxford English School, and Tolkien wrote a letter expressing his
          desire to return there which he died in 1925. Tolkien assisted Sir
          Mortimer Wheeler in the unearthing of a Roman Asclepieion at Lydney
          Park, Gloucestershire, in 1928. During his time at Pembroke, Tolkien
          wrote <b> The Hobbit</b> and the first two volumes of The Lord of the
          Rings. Of Tolkien's academic publications, the 1936 lecture
          <b> "Beowulf: The Monsters and the Critics"</b> had a lasting
          influence on Beowulf research. Around the time The Hobbit was
          published (1937) Tolkien suffered from an ailment and had to use
          crutches, the only time he was free from examining work.
        </p>
        <p id="lotr" className="responsive-p">
          <ContentHeader>lord of the rings</ContentHeader>
          The success of The Hobbit and a request for its sequel, was an
          oportunity to combine his personal desire for writing, and financial
          needs, and agreed on writing a sequel. In the turn of 1939, and in the
          midst of writing the Lord of the Rings, Tolkien faced financial stress
          and was obliged to do exams and lectures: his son, Michael was
          preparing for university, and Christopher, being home-schooled for
          health reasons, wanted to go to school. In the summer of that year,
          while gardening, Tolkien fell and suffered a concussion which required
          stitches; he was unwell for some time and this, along with his
          fatigue, worries, obligations, Edith's illness, his loss of his chief
          assistant and understudy, prevented him from continuing his writing,
          including a foreword to Beowulf as had promised. At the outbreak of
          WWII, his academic duties increased. Juggling between work, "Civil
          Defence" and writing in intervals, he doubted that, because of the
          War, completing the book had any use. Failing to progress during
          Christmas vacations, he resumed only two years later. It was the
          enthusiasm of his friends and Christopher (to whom he was sending
          copies by mail to South Africa) who encouraged him to continue. <br />
          <br /> xxv In 1945, he moved to <b>Merton College</b>, Oxford,
          becoming the Merton Professor of English Language and Literature, in
          which post he remained until his retirement in 1959. In 1946 he faced
          fatigue from academic work and an illness, and although he recovered,
          and was free from examining work, he had to deal with a "mountain of
          neglects". Tolkien spent the late summer (August-September) of 1948,
          at the home of Michael at Payables Farm, Woodcote. As Michael and his
          family were on holidays, Tolkien found the time and quiet he needed to
          finish Lord of the Rings, close to a decade after the first sketches.
          <br /> <br />
          xxvii After a disagreement with <b>Allen and Unwin</b> concerning "The
          Silmarillion", and failing to reach an agreement with Collins, he
          settled the dispute with the Unwins. He reported to
          <b>Rayner Unwin</b> that he had been unwell (having recovered from "a
          terrible bout" of fibrositis and neuritis of the arm) burdened and
          downhearted. In the prospect of a nearing retirement of poverty,
          during which he would work as an examiner to survive, and the raising
          paper costs, he had modified his views ("Better something than
          nothing!"). Tolkien readily agreed to the 'profit-sharing'
          arrangement, where Tolkien would not receive an advance or royalties
          until the books had broken even. Between 1953 and 1955 Tolkien worked
          closely with Allen & Unwin on production of The Lord of the Rings,
          agreeing on the division of volumes, their titles, correcting proofs
          that arrived at intervals, complete and correct artwork, the maps and
          the dust-jacket designs.

          Already in 1944, he made a somewhat sarcastic comment about a fan
          letter by a twelve-year-old American reader ("It's nice to find that
          little American boys do really still say 'Gee Whiz'"). During the
          1950s, Tolkien spent many of his long academic holidays at the home of
          his son John Francis in Stoke-on-Trent. In 1959 Tolkien went to
          compulsory retirement, which he found "both distressing, and extremely
          laborious", especially with the less than desirable pension. For him,
          1963 was a "dreadful year", including the death of C.S. Lewis (22
          November), an illness that prevented Tolkien and Edith to celebrate
          Christmas, and after that, Faith Faulconbridge leaving Christopher;
          Tolkien expressed "fear they have left their allegiance to our Mother
          ".

          In the 1960s he complained about the effects of old age, and other
          difficulties and anxieties, some of which were caused by his own
          family. By the time of his retirement, Tolkien increasingly turned
          into a figure of public attention and literary fame. The sale of his
          books was so profitable that Tolkien regretted he had not taken early
          retirement. While at first he wrote enthusiastic answers to reader
          inquiries, he became more and more suspicious of emerging Tolkien
          fandom, especially among the hippy movement in the USA. <br />
          <br /> Fan attention became so intense that, with <b>Joy Hill's</b>
          suggestion, Tolkien had to take his phone number out of the public
          directory, and eventually he and Edith moved to Woodridings in
          Branksome, Poole near Bournemouth to escape his fame in Oxford. In
          June 1968, while preparing to move house, Tolkien fell down a set of
          stairs and had to stay in an Oxford hospital, leaving behind his
          obligations. He was expected to use crutches for all summer. The
          couple lived in Poole until Edith's death in November 1971 The widowed
          professor moved back Oxford, 21 Merton Street in March 1972. Tolkien
          had an intense dislike for the side effects of industrialization,
          which he considered a devouring of the English countryside. For most
          of his adult life he eschewed automobiles, preferring to ride a
          bicycle. This attitude is perceptible from some parts of his work,
          such as the forced industrialization of <b>The Shire</b> in The Lord
          of the Rings. <br />

          <br /> <b>W.H. Auden</b> was a frequent correspondent and long-time
          friend of Tolkien's, initiated by Auden's fascination with The Lord of
          the Rings: Auden was among the most prominent early critics to praise
          the work. Tolkien wrote in a 1971 letter. <br />
          <br />
          Tolkien was awarded a CBE ("Commander of the British Empire") by Queen
          Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace on March 28, 1972. Edith Tolkien
          died on November 29, 1971, at the age of eighty-two, and Tolkien had
          the name Lúthien engraved on the stone at <b>Wolvercote Cemetery</b>,
          Oxford. When Tolkien died 21 months later of pneumonia on September 2,
          1973, at the age of 81, he was buried in the same grave, with Beren
          added to his name, so that the engraving now reads:

          <h5 className="m-2">John Ronald Reuel Tolkien, Beren, 1892 - 1973</h5>
          Posthumously named after Tolkien are the Tolkien Road in Eastbourne,
          East Sussex, and the asteroid 2675 Tolkien. Tolkien Way in
          Stoke-On-Trent is named after J.R.R.'s son Father

          themes that were reused in successive drafts of his legendarium. The
          two most prominent stories, the tales of Beren and Lúthien and that of
          Túrin, were carried forward into long narrative poems (published in
          <b>The Lays of Beleriand</b> ). Tolkien wrote a brief summary of the
          mythology these poems were intended to represent, and that summary
          eventually evolved into <b>"The Silmarillion"</b>, an epic history
          that Tolkien started three times but never published. The story of
          this continuous redrafting is told in the posthumous series The
          <b>History of Middle-earth</b>. From around 1936, he began to extend
          this framework to include the tale of <b>The Fall of Númenor</b>,
          which was inspired by the legend of <b>Atlantis</b>. <br />

          Tolkien was strongly influenced by Anglo-Saxon literature, Germanic
          and <b>Norse mythologies</b>, Finnish mythology, the Bible, and Greek
          mythology. The works most often cited as sources for Tolkien's stories
          include <b>Beowulf</b>, the <b>Kalevala</b>, the <b>Poetic Edda</b>,
          the <b>Volsunga saga</b> and the <b>Hervarar saga</b>. Tolkien himself
          acknowledged Homer, Oedipus, and the Kalevala as influences or sources
          for some of his stories and ideas. His borrowings also came from
          numerous Middle English works and poems. A major philosophical
          influence on his writing is King Alfred's Anglo-Saxon version of
          Boethius' Consolation of Philosophy known as the Lays of Boethius.
          Characters in The Lord of the Rings, such as Frodo, Treebeard and
          Elrond make noticeably Boethian remarks. <br />
          <br />
          In addition to his mythological compositions, Tolkien enjoyed
          inventing fantasy stories to entertain his children. He wrote annual
          Christmas letters from Father Christmas for them, building up a series
          of short stories (later compiled and published as The Father Christmas
          Letters). Other stories included Mr. Bliss, Roverandom, Smith of
          Wootton Major, Farmer Giles of Ham and Leaf by Niggle. Roverandom and
          Smith of Wootton Major, like The Hobbit, borrowed ideas from his
          legendarium. Leaf by Niggle appears to be an autobiographical work,
          where a "very small man", Niggle, keeps painting leaves until finally
          he ends up with a tree. <br />
          <br />
          Tolkien never expected his fictional stories to become popular, but he
          was persuaded by a former student to publish a book he had written for
          his own children called The Hobbit in 1937. However, the book
          attracted adult readers as well, and it became popular enough for the
          publisher, <b>George Allen & Unwin</b>, to ask Tolkien to work on a
          sequel. <br /> Even though he felt uninspired on the topic, this
          request prompted Tolkien to begin what would become his most famous
          work: the epic three-volume novel The Lord of the Rings (published
          1954–55). Tolkien spent more than ten years writing the primary
          narrative and appendices for The Lord of the Rings, during which time
          he received the constant support of the Inklings, in particular his
          closest friend C.S. Lewis, the author of The
          <b>Chronicles of Narnia</b>. Both The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings
          are set against the background of "The Silmarillion", but in a time
          long after it. Tolkien at first intended The Lord of the Rings as a
          children's tale like The Hobbit, but it quickly grew darker and more
          serious in the writing. Though a direct sequel to The Hobbit, it
          addressed an older audience, drawing on the immense back story of
          Beleriand that Tolkien had constructed in previous years, and which
          eventually saw posthumous publication in The Silmarillion and other
          volumes. Tolkien's influence weighs heavily on the fantasy genre that
          grew up after the success of The Lord of the Rings. <br />
          <br />
          Tolkien continued to work on the history of Middle-earth until his
          death. His son Christopher, with some assistance from fantasy writer
          Guy Gavriel Kay, organised some of this material into one volume,
          published as The Silmarillion in 1977. In 1980, Christopher Tolkien
          followed this with a collection of more fragmentary material under the
          title Unfinished Tales, and in subsequent years he published a massive
          amount of background material on the creation of Middle-earth in the
          twelve volumes of The History of Middle-earth. All these posthumous
          works contain unfinished, abandoned, alternative and outright
          contradictory accounts, since they were always a work in progress, and
          Tolkien only rarely settled on a definitive version for any of the
          stories. There is not even complete consistency to be found between
          The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit, the two most closely related
          works, because Tolkien was never able to fully integrate all their
          traditions into each other. He commented in 1965, while editing The
          Hobbit for a third edition, that he would have preferred to completely
          rewrite the entire book. <b>The John P. Raynor</b>, S.J., Library at
          Marquette University in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, preserves many of
          Tolkien's original manuscripts, notes and letters; other original
          material survives at Oxford's <b>Bodleian Library</b>. Marquette has
          the manuscripts and proofs of The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit,
          and other manuscripts, including Farmer Giles of Ham, while the
          Bodleian holds "The Silmarillion" papers and Tolkien's academic work.
          <br /> <br /> The Lord of the Rings became immensely popular in the
          1960s and has remained so ever since, ranking as one of the most
          popular works of fiction of the twentieth century, judged by both
          sales and reader surveys. In the 2003 "Big Read" survey conducted by
          the BBC, The Lord of the Rings was found to be the "Nation's
          Best-loved Book". Australians voted The Lord of the Rings "My
          Favourite Book" in a 2004 survey conducted by the Australian ABC. In a
          1999 poll of Amazon.com customers, The Lord of the Rings was judged to
          be their favourite "book of the millennium". In 2002 Tolkien was voted
          the ninety-second "greatest Briton" in a poll conducted by the BBC,
          and in 2004 he was voted thirty-fifth in the SABC3's Great South
          Africans, the only person to appear in both lists. His popularity is
          not limited just to the English-speaking world: in a 2004 poll
          inspired by the UK's "Big Read" survey, about 250,000 Germans found
          The Lord of the Rings (Der Herr der Ringe) to be their favourite work
          of literature.

          At the age of 16, Tolkien met <b>Edith Mary Bratt</b>, who was three
          years his senior, when he and his brother Hilary moved into the
          boarding house where she lived in Duchess Road, <b>Edgbaston</b>.
          According to Humphrey Carpenter, "Edith and Ronald took to frequenting
          Birmingham teashops, especially one which had a balcony overlooking
          the pavement. There they would sit and throw sugarlumps into the hats
          of passers-by, moving to the next table when the sugar bowl was empty.
          ... With two people of their personalities and in their position,
          romance was bound to flourish. Both were orphans in need of affection,
          and they found that they could give it to each other. During the
          summer of 1909, they decided that they were in love." His guardian,
          Father Morgan, considered it "altogether unfortunate" that his
          surrogate son was romantically involved with an older,{" "}
          <b>Protestant</b>
          woman; Tolkien wrote that the combined tensions contributed to his
          having "muffed exams". Morgan prohibited him from meeting, talking to,
          or even corresponding with Edith until he was 21. Tolkien obeyed this
          prohibition to the letter, with one notable early exception, over
          which Father Morgan threatened to cut short his university career if
          he did not stop. On the evening of his 21st birthday, Tolkien wrote to
          Edith, who was living with family friend C. H. Jessop at
          <b> Cheltenham</b>. <br />
          <br /> He declared that he had never ceased to love her, and asked her
          to marry him. Edith replied that she had already accepted the proposal
          of George Field, the brother of one of her closest school friends. But
          Edith said she had agreed to marry Field only because she felt "on the
          shelf" and had begun to doubt that Tolkien still cared for her. She
          explained that, because of Tolkien's letter, everything had changed.
          On <b>8 January 1913</b>, Tolkien travelled by train to Cheltenham and
          was met on the platform by Edith. The two took a walk into the
          countryside, sat under a railway viaduct, and talked. By the end of
          the day, Edith had agreed to accept Tolkien's proposal. She wrote to
          Field and returned her engagement ring. Field was{" "}
          <b>"dreadfully upset at first"</b>, and the Field family was "insulted
          and angry". Upon learning of Edith's new plans, Jessop wrote to her
          guardian, "I have nothing to say against Tolkien, he is a cultured
          gentleman, but his prospects are poor in the extreme, and when he will
          be in a position to marry I cannot imagine. Had he adopted a
          profession it would have been different." Following their engagement,
          Edith reluctantly announced that she was converting to Catholicism at
          Tolkien's insistence. Jessop, "like many others of his age and class
          ... strongly anti-Catholic", was infuriated, and he ordered Edith to
          find other lodgings. Edith Bratt and Ronald Tolkien were formally
          engaged at Birmingham in January 1913, and married at{" "}
          <b>St Mary Immaculate Catholic Church</b> at Warwick, on 22 March
          1916. In his 1941 letter to Michael, Tolkien expressed admiration for
          his wife's willingness to marry a man with no job, little money, and
          no prospects except the likelihood of being killed in the Great War.

          In August 1914, Britain entered the <b>First World War</b>. Tolkien's
          relatives were shocked when he elected not to volunteer immediately
          for the <b>British Army</b>. In a 1941 letter to his son Michael,
          Tolkien recalled: "In those days chaps joined up, or were scorned
          publicly. It was a nasty cleft to be in for a young man with too much
          imagination and little physical courage." Instead, Tolkien, "endured
          the obloquy", and entered a programme by which he delayed enlistment
          until completing his degree. By the time he passed his finals in July
          1915, Tolkien recalled that the hints were "becoming outspoken from
          relatives". He was commissioned as a temporary second lieutenant in
          the <b>Lancashire Fusiliers</b> on 15 July 1915. He trained with the
          13th (Reserve) Battalion on <b>Cannock Chase</b>, Rugeley Camp near to
          Rugeley, Staffordshire, for 11 months. In a letter to Edith, Tolkien
          complained: "Gentlemen are rare among the superiors, and even human
          beings rare indeed." Following their wedding, Lieutenant and Mrs.
          Tolkien took up lodgings near the training camp. On 2 June 1916,
          Tolkien received a telegram summoning him to <b>Folkestone</b> for
          posting to France. The Tolkiens spent the night before his departure
          in a room at the Plough & Harrow Hotel in <b>Edgbaston</b>,
          Birmingham. He later wrote: "Junior officers were being killed off, a
          dozen a minute. Parting from my wife then... it was like a death."
          <h4 className="m-3 color-white">France</h4>
          On 5 June 1916, Tolkien boarded a troop transport for an overnight
          voyage to <b>Calais</b>. Like other soldiers arriving for the first
          time, he was sent to the <b>British Expeditionary Force's</b> base
          depot at Étaples. On 7 June, he was informed that he had been assigned
          as a signals officer to the 11th (Service) Battalion, Lancashire
          Fusiliers. The battalion was part of the <b>74th Brigade</b>, 25th
          Division. While waiting to be summoned to his unit, Tolkien sank into
          boredom. To pass the time, he composed a poem titled The Lonely Isle,
          which was inspired by his feelings during the sea crossing to Calais.
          To evade the British Army's postal censorship, he developed a code of
          dots by which Edith could track his movements. He left Étaples on 27
          June 1916 and joined his battalion at <b>Rubempré</b>, near Amiens.He
          found himself commanding enlisted men who were drawn mainly from the
          mining, milling, and weaving towns of Lancashire. According to{" "}
          <b>John Garth</b>, he "felt an affinity for these working class men",
          but military protocol prohibited friendships with "other ranks".
          Instead, he was required to "take charge of them, discipline them,
          train them, and probably censor their letters ... If possible, he was
          supposed to inspire their love and loyalty." Tolkien later lamented,
          "The most improper job of any man ... is bossing other men. Not one in
          a million is fit for it, and least of all those who seek the
          opportunity."
          <h4 className="m-3 color-white">Battle of the Somme</h4>
          Tolkien arrived at the <b>Somme</b> in early July 1916. In between
          terms behind the lines at <b>Bouzincourt</b>, he participated in the
          assaults on the <b>Schwaben Redoubt</b> and the <b>Leipzig salient</b>
          . Tolkien's time in combat was a terrible stress for Edith, who feared
          that every knock on the door might carry news of her husband's death.
          Edith could track her husband's movements on a map of the{" "}
          <b>Western Front</b>. The Reverend Mervyn S. Evers, Anglican chaplain
          to the Lancashire Fusiliers, recorded that Tolkien and his fellow
          officers were eaten by "hordes of lice" which found the Medical
          Officer's ointment merely "a kind of hors d'oeuvre and the little
          beggars went at their feast with renewed vigour." On 27 October 1916,
          as his battalion attacked Regina Trench, Tolkien contracted trench
          fever, a disease carried by lice. He was invalided to England on 8
          November 1916. <br />

          According to his children <b>John</b> and <b>Priscilla Tolkien</b>,
          "In later years, he would occasionally talk of being at the front: of
          the horrors of the first German gas attack, of the utter exhaustion
          and ominous quiet after a bombardment, of the whining scream of the
          shells, and the endless marching, always on foot, through a devastated
          landscape, sometimes carrying the men's equipment as well as his own
          to encourage them to keep going. ... <br /> Some remarkable relics
          survive from that time: a trench map he drew himself; pencil-written
          orders to carry bombs to the 'fighting line.'" Many of his dearest
          school friends were killed in the war. Among their number were Rob
          Gilson of the Tea Club and Barrovian Society, who was killed on the
          first day of the Somme while leading his men in the assault on{" "}
          <b>Beaumont Hamel</b>. Fellow T.C.B.S. member Geoffrey Smith was
          killed during the battle, when a German artillery shell landed on a
          first-aid post. Tolkien's battalion was almost completely wiped out
          following his return to England. Men of the 1st Battalion, Lancashire

          which Tolkien served, at once marked existing social boundaries and
          counteracted the class system by throwing everyone into a desperate
          situation together. Tolkien was grateful, writing that it had taught
          him "a deep sympathy and feeling for the Tommy; especially the plain
          soldier from the agricultural counties".
          <h4 className="m-3 color-white">Home Front</h4>A weak and emaciated
          Tolkien spent the remainder of the war alternating between hospitals
          and garrison duties, being deemed medically unfit for general service.
          During his recovery in a cottage in <b>Little Haywood</b>,
          Staffordshire, he began to work on what he called{" "}
          <b>The Book of Lost Tales</b>, beginning with{" "}
          <b>The Fall of Gondolin</b>. Lost Tales represented Tolkien's attempt
          to create a mythology for England, a project he would abandon without
          ever completing. Throughout 1917 and 1918 his illness kept recurring,
          but he had recovered enough to do home service at various camps. It
          was at this time that Edith bore their first child, John Francis Reuel
          Tolkien. In a 1941 letter, Tolkien described his son John as
          "(conceived and carried during the starvation-year of 1917 and the
          great U-boat campaign) round about the <b>Battle of Cambrai</b>, when
          the end of the war seemed as far off as it does now".

          Tolkien was promoted to the temporary rank of lieutenant on 6 January
          1918. When he was stationed at Kingston upon Hull, he and Edith went
          walking in the woods at nearby Roos, and Edith began to dance for him
          in a clearing among the flowering hemlock. After his wife's death in
          1971, Tolkien remembered, <br />
          <br />
          <q>
            <i className="color-white">
              I never called Edith Luthien—but she was the source of the story
              that in time became the chief part of the Silmarillion. It was
              first conceived in a small woodland glade filled with hemlocks at
              Roos in Yorkshire (where I was for a brief time in command of an
              outpost of the Humber Garrison in 1917, and she was able to live
              with me for a while). In those days her hair was raven, her skin
              clear, her eyes brighter than you have seen them, and she could
              sing—and dance. But the story has gone crooked, & I am left, and I
              cannot plead before the inexorable Mandos.

          During his life in retirement, from 1959 up to his death in 1973,
          Tolkien received steadily increasing public attention and literary
          fame. In 1961, his friend <b>C. S. Lewis</b> even nominated him for
          the <b>Nobel Prize in Literature.</b> The sales of his books were so
          profitable that he regretted that he had not chosen early retirement.
          In a 1972 letter, he deplored having become a cult-figure, but
          admitted that "even the nose of a very modest idol ... cannot remain
          entirely untickled by the sweet smell of incense!" Fan attention
          became so intense that Tolkien had to take his phone number out of the
          public directory, and eventually he and Edith moved to{" "}
          <b>Bournemouth</b>, which was then a seaside resort patronized by the
          British upper middle class. Tolkien's status as a best-selling author
          gave them easy entry into polite society, but Tolkien deeply missed
          the company of his fellow Inklings. Edith, however, was overjoyed to
          step into the role of a society hostess, which had been the reason
          that Tolkien selected Bournemouth in the first place. <br />

          The genuine and deep affection between Ronald and Edith was
          demonstrated by their care about the other's health, in details like
          wrapping presents, in the generous way he gave up his life at Oxford
          so she could retire to Bournemouth, and in her pride in his becoming a
          famous author. They were tied together, too, by love for their
          children and grandchildren. In his retirement Tolkien was a consultant
          and translator for <b>The Jerusalem Bible</b>, published in 1966. He
          was initially assigned a larger portion to translate, but, due to
          other commitments, only managed to offer some criticisms of other
          contributors and a translation of the <b>Book of Jonah.</b> <br />
          <br />
