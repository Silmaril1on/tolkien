          </div>
          Sir Peter Robert Jackson (born 31 October 1961) is a New Zealand film
          director, screenwriter and producer. He is best known as the director,
          writer and producer of the <b>Lord of the Rings trilogy</b>{" "}
          (2001–2003) and the <b>Hobbit trilogy</b> (2012–2014), both of which
          are adapted from the novels of the same name by J. R. R. Tolkien.
          Other notable films include the critically lauded drama{" "}
          <b>Heavenly Creatures</b> (1994), the horror comedy{" "}
          <b>The Frighteners</b>
          (1996), the epic monster remake film <b>King Kong</b> (2005), the
          World War I documentary film <b>They Shall Not Grow Old</b> (2018) and
          the documentary <b>The Beatles: Get Back</b> (2021). He is the
          fourth-highest-grossing film director of all-time, his films having
          made over $6.5 billion worldwide. Jackson began his career with the
          "splatstick" horror comedy Bad Taste (1987) and the black comedy Meet
          the Feebles (1989) before filming the zombie comedy <b>Braindead</b>{" "}
          (1992). <br />
          <br />
          He shared a nomination for Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay
          with his partner Fran Walsh for Heavenly Creatures, which brought him
          to mainstream prominence in the film industry. Jackson has been
          awarded three Academy Awards for{" "}
          <b>The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King</b> (2003), including
          Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Adapted Screenplay, His other
          awards include three BAFTAs, a <b>Golden Globe</b>, two Primetime{" "}
          <b>Emmy Awards</b> and four Saturn Awards among others. His production
          company is WingNut Films, and his most regular collaborators are
          co-writers and producers <b>Walsh</b> and
          <b>Philippa Boyens</b>. Jackson was made a Companion of the New
          Zealand Order of Merit in 2002. He was later knighted (as a Knight
          Companion of the order) by Sir Anand Satyanand, the Governor-General
          of New Zealand, at a ceremony in Wellington in April 2010. In December
          2014, Jackson was awarded a star on the <b>Hollywood Walk of Fame.</b>

          <ContentHeader>early life</ContentHeader>
          Jackson was born on 31 October 1961 in <b>Wellington</b> and was
          raised in its far northern suburb of <b>Pukerua Bay.</b> His parents –
          Joan (née Ruck), a factory worker and housewife, and William "Bill"
          Jackson, a wages clerk – were immigrants from England. <br /> As a
          child, Jackson was a keen film fan, growing up on{" "}
          <b>Ray Harryhausen</b> films, as well as finding inspiration in the
          television series <b>Thunderbirds</b> and{" "}
          <b>Monty Python's Flying Circus.</b> After a family friend gave the
          Jacksons a Super 8 cine-camera with Peter in mind, he began making
          short films with his friends. Jackson has long cited King Kong as his
          favourite film, and around the age of nine he attempted to remake it
          using his own stop-motion models. <br />{" "}
          <div className="float-left">
            <img className="img-150" src={jackson2} alt="jackson" />
          </div>
          <br /> Also, as a child Jackson made a <b>World War II</b> epic called
          The Dwarf Patrol seen on the Bad Taste bonus disc, which featured his
          first special effect of poking pinholes in the film for gun shots, and
          a <b>James Bond</b> spoof named <b>Coldfinger</b>. Most notable though
          was a 20-minute short called The Valley, which won him a special prize
          because of the shots he used. Jackson attended <b>Kāpiti College</b>,
          where he expressed no interest in sports. His classmates also remember
          him wearing a duffel coat with "an obsession verging on religious". He
          had no formal training in film-making, but learned about editing,
          special effects and make-up largely through his own trial and error.
          As a young adult, Jackson discovered the work of author J. R. R.
          Tolkien after watching <b>The Lord of the Rings</b> (1978), an
          animated film by <b>Ralph Bakshi</b> that was a part-adaptation of
          Tolkien's fantasy trilogy. <br />
          <br /> When he was 16 years old, Jackson left school and began working
          full-time as a photo-engraver for a Wellington newspaper, The Evening
          Post. For the seven years he worked there, Jackson lived at home with
          his parents so he could save as much money as possible to spend on
          film equipment. After two years of work Jackson bought a 16 mm camera,
          and began shooting a film that later became Bad Taste. <br />
          <br />
          Jackson has long cited several films as influences. It is well known
          that Jackson has a passion for King Kong, often citing it as his
          favourite film and as the film that inspired him early in his life.
          Jackson recalls attempting to remake King Kong when he was nine. At
          the 2009 <b>San Diego Comic-Con International</b>, while being
          interviewed alongside <b>Avatar</b> and <b>Titanic</b> director{" "}
          <b>James Cameron</b>, Jackson said certain films gave him a "kick". He
          mentioned <b>Martin Scorsese's</b> crime films <b>Goodfellas</b> and{" "}
          <b>Casino</b>, remarking on "something about those particular movies
          and the way Martin Scorsese just fearlessly rockets his camera around
          and has shot those films that I can watch those movies and feel
          inspired." Jackson said the 1970 film Waterloo inspired him in his
          youth. Other influences include <b>George Romero</b>, <b>Sam Raimi</b>{" "}
          and the special effects by <b>Ray Harryhausen</b>.

          <h4>Splatter phase</h4>
          Jackson's first feature was <b>Bad Taste</b>, a haphazard fashion{" "}
          <b>splatter </b>
          comedy which took years to make, it included many of Jackson's friends
          acting and working on it for free. Shooting was normally done in the
          weekends since Jackson was then working full-time. Bad Taste is about
          aliens that come to earth with the intention of turning humans into
          food. Jackson had two acting roles including a famous scene in which
          he fights himself on top of a cliff. The film was finally completed
          thanks to a late injection of finance from the{" "}
          <b>New Zealand Film Commission</b>, after Jim Booth, the body's
          executive director, became convinced of Jackson's talent (Booth later
          left the commission to become Jackson's producer). Bad Taste debuted
          at the <b>Cannes Film Festival</b> in May 1987. <br />
          <br /> Around this time, Jackson began working on writing a number of
          film scripts, in varied collaborative groupings with playwright
          Stephen Sinclair, writer Fran Walsh and writer/actor Danny Mulheron.
          Walsh would later become his life partner. Some of the scripts from
          this period, including a sequel to A Nightmare on Elm Street, have
          never been made into movies; the proposed zombie film{" "}
          <b>Braindead </b>
          underwent extensive rewrites. Jackson's next film to see release was
          Meet the Feebles (1989), co-written with Sinclair, Walsh and Mulheron.
          Begun on a very low budget, <b>Meet the Feebles</b> went weeks over
          schedule. Jackson stated of his second feature-length film, "It's got
          a quality of humour that alienates a lot of people. It's very black,
          very satirical, very savage." <br />
          <br />{" "}

          </div>
          <h4>Heavenly Creatures and Forgotten Silver</h4>
          Released in 1994 after Jackson won a race to bring the story to the
          screen, <b>Heavenly Creatures</b> marked a major change for Jackson in
          terms of both style and tone. The real-life 1950s{" "}
          <b>Parker–Hulme murder case</b>, in which two teenage girls murdered
          one of their mothers, inspired the film. It was Fran Walsh that
          persuaded him that these events had the makings of a movie, Jackson
          has been quoted saying that the film "only got made" because of her
          enthusiasm for the subject matter. The film's fame coincided with the
          New Zealand media tracking down the real-life Juliet Hulme, who now
          writes books under the name <b>Anne Perry</b>. Melanie Lynskey and{" "}
          <b>Kate Winslet</b> played Parker and Hulme, respectively. Heavenly
          Creatures was critically acclaimed and was nominated for Best Original
          Screenplay at the Academy Awards and making top ten of the year lists
          in Time, <b>The Guardian, The Sydney Morning Herald</b>, and The New
          Zealand Herald. The following year, in collaboration with Wellington
          film-maker Costa Botes, Jackson co-directed the mockumentary Forgotten
          Silver (1995). <br />
          <br /> This ambitious made-for-television piece told the story of New
          Zealand film pioneer <b>Colin McKenzie</b>, who had supposedly
          invented colour film and 'talkies', and attempted an epic film of
          Salome before being forgotten by the world. Though the programme
          played in a slot normally reserved for drama, no other warning was
          given that it was fictionalised and many viewers were outraged at
          discovering Colin McKenzie had never existed.The number of people who
          believed the increasingly improbable story provides testimony to
          Jackson and Botes' skill at playing on New Zealand's national myth of
          a nation of innovators and forgotten trail-blazers.
          <h4>Hollywood, Weta, and the Film Commission</h4>
          The success of Heavenly Creatures helped pave the way for Jackson's
          first big budget Hollywood film, The Frighteners starring Michael J.
          Fox, in 1996. Jackson was given permission to make this comedy /
          horror film entirely in New Zealand despite being set in a North
          American town. This period was a key one of change for both Jackson
          and Weta Workshop, the special effects company – born from the one-man
          contributions of George Port to Heavenly Creatures – with which
          Jackson is often associated. Weta, initiated by Jackson and key
          collaborators, grew rapidly during this period to incorporate both
          digital and physical effects, make-up and costumes, the first two
          areas normally commanded by Jackson collaborator <b>Richard Taylor</b>
          . <br />
          <br /> The Frighteners was regarded as a box office failure. Film
          critic <b>Roger Ebert</b> expressed disappointment stating that
          "incredible effort has resulted in a film that looks more like a demo
          reel than a movie". In February 1997, Jackson launched legal
          proceedings against the New Zealand Listener magazine for defamation,
          over a review of The Frighteners which claimed that the film was
          "built from the rubble of other people's movies". In the end, the case
          was not pursued further. Around this time Jackson's remake of King
          Kong was shelved by
          <b>Universal Studios</b>, partly because of <b>Mighty Joe Young</b>{" "}
          and <b>Godzilla</b>, both giant monster movies, that had already gone
          into production. Universal feared it would be thrown aside by the two
          higher budget movies. This period of transition seems not to have been
          entirely a happy one; it also marked one of the high points of tension
          between Jackson and the <b>New Zealand Film Commission</b> since Meet
          the Feebles had gone over-budget earlier in his career. <br /> Jackson
          has claimed the Commission considered firing him from Feebles, though
          the NZFC went on to help fund his next three films. In 1997, the
          director submitted a lengthy criticism of the commission for a
          magazine supplement meant to celebrate the body's 20th anniversary,
          criticising what he called inconsistent decision-making by
          inexperienced board members. The magazine felt that the material was
          too long and potentially defamatory to publish in that form; a
          shortened version of the material went on to appear in Metro magazine.
          In the Metro article Jackson criticized the Commission over funding
          decisions concerning a film he was hoping to executive produce, but
          refused to drop a client-confidentiality provision that would have
          allowed them to publicly reply to his criticisms.
          <h4>lord of the rings</h4>
          Jackson won the rights to film Tolkien's epic in 1997 after meeting
          with producer <b>Saul Zaentz</b>. Originally working with{" "}
          <b>Miramax Films</b>
          towards a two-film production, Jackson was later pressured to render
          the story as a single film, and finally overcame a tight deadline by
          making a last-minute deal with <b>New Line</b>, who were keen on a
          trilogy.

              Wellington.
            </h6>
          </div>
          <b>Principal photography</b> stretched from 11 October 1999 to 22
          December 2000 with extensive location filming across New Zealand. With
          the benefit of extended post-production and extra periods of shooting
          before each film's release, the series met with huge success and sent
          Jackson's popularity soaring. <br />
          <br /> The <b>Return of the King</b> itself met with huge critical
          acclaim, winning all eleven Oscars it was nominated for, including
          <b>Best Picture</b> and <b>Best Director</b>. The film was the first
          of the fantasy film genre to win the award for Best Picture and was
          the second sequel to win Best Picture (the first being The Godfather
          Part II). Jackson's mother, Joan, died three days before the release
          of the first movie in the trilogy, The Fellowship of the Ring. There
          was a special showing of the film after her funeral.
          <h4>the hobbit</h4>
          Jackson's involvement in the making of a film version of{" "}
          <b>The Hobbit</b>
          has a long and chequered history. In November 2006, a letter from
          Peter Jackson and Fran Walsh stated that due to an ongoing legal
          dispute between Wingnut Films (Jackson's production company) and{" "}
          <b>New Line Cinema</b>, Jackson would not be directing the film. New
          Line Cinema's head <b>Robert Shaye</b> commented that Jackson "...
          will never make any movie with New Line Cinema again while I'm still
          working at the company ...". This prompted an online call for a
          boycott of New Line Cinema, and by August 2007 Shaye was trying to
          repair his working relationship. On 18 December 2007, it was announced
          that Jackson and New Line Cinema had reached agreement to make two
          prequels, both based on The Hobbit, and to be released in 2012 and
          2013 with Jackson as a writer and executive producer and{" "}
          <b>Guillermo del Toro</b> directing. In early 2010, del Toro dropped
          out due to production delays and a month later Jackson was back in
          negotiations to direct The Hobbit; and on 15 October he was finalised
          as the director – with New Zealand confirmed as the location a couple
          of weeks later. <br /> The film started production on 20 March 2011.
          On 30 July 2012, Jackson announced on his Facebook page that the two
          planned Hobbit movies would be expanded into a trilogy. He wrote that
          the third film would not act as a bridge between The Hobbit and The
          Lord of the Rings films, but would continue to expand The Hobbit story
          by using material found in the Lord of the Rings Appendices.
          <h4>the beatles: get back</h4>
          On 30 January 2019, the fiftieth anniversary of the <b>Beatles</b> '
          rooftop concert, which was the band's final performance, Jackson
          announced that his next directorial work would be a documentary about
          the making of their final album Let It Be. In a process similar to his
          previous documentary project They Shall Not Grow Old, this created
          around "55 hours of never-before-seen footage and 140 hours of audio
          made available to, which are "the only footage of any note that
          documents them at work in the studio". The documentary used the
          techniques developed for They Shall Not Grow Old to transform the
          footage with modern production techniques, and seeks to display a new
          side of a period in the Beatles' history usually remembered as highly
          conflictual. Most of the used footage was originally recorded for the
          1970 Let It Be documentary. <br /> <br />
          <b>Clare Olssen</b> and <b>Jabez Olssen</b> , respectively producer
          and editor of They Shall Not Grow Old, returned for this new project,
          with Ken Kamins, Jeff Jones and Jonathan Clyde as executive producers.
          The project was made with "the full co-operation" of Paul McCartney
          and Ringo Starr, the last two living Beatles, as well as John Lennon
          and George Harrison's widows Yoko Ono and Olivia Harrison. The film
          includes the full 42-minute last rooftop concert. <b>In March 2020</b>{" "}
          , Walt Disney Studios announced they had acquired the worldwide
          distribution rights to Jackson's documentary, now titled The Beatles:
          Get Back. It was originally set to be released by{" "}
          <b>Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures</b> on 27 August 2021 in the US
          and Canada with a subsequent global release to follow. In June 2021,
          it was announced that it would be released on Disney+ as a three-part
          documentary series on 25, 26 and 27 November 2021. The documentary was
          released to mostly favorable reviews. It has a score of 93 percent on
          Rotten Tomatoes and a metascore of 85 on Metacritic.
